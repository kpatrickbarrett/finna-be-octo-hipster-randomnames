# finna-be-octo-hipster-randomnames
I chose this random name because github gave it to me.

I did this at work in 15 minutes, trying to come up with random names to put in the dell support chat window. 
This list uses last names from the census, from a list I found on stackoverflow, and actually takes the last names as first names too, for the added hilarity.
